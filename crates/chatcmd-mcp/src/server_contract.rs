pub(crate) mod instructions;

const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "IDENTITY: one ChatGPT chat maps to one ChatCMD task context. ChatCMD tools may be called directly without first calling agent_user_message. When a taskId or turnId is already available, reuse it for related lifecycle/reporting calls; otherwise the server may bootstrap task identity from the authenticated conversation context. ChatCMD validates conversation ownership server-side so a stale taskId from another chat must not merge two chats. agent_user_message is optional lifecycle bookkeeping and is not an execution prerequisite. SHARED PROJECT SELECTION: when the current request identifies a project with [repository-name] or [new project: name] (also [새 프로젝트: name]), call agent_user_message once near the beginning with the exact current user message. The server resolves a unique direct child of currently shared parents for an existing project, or the single shared parent for a new project. Use the returned projectFolder and load workspace_context and relevant skills for that task. A selector must be a leading bracket tag, optionally after one agent mention, followed by whitespace or the end of the message. Follow-up messages retain the most recent accepted project selection in this task. Ordinary bracket text and Markdown links do not change it. The sharedProjectSelection result identifies a selection accepted for this message; null does not confirm a newly requested target. If the user intends a different project and that selection was not accepted, clarify before making changes rather than acting on the previous project. These selections never grant lasting access and are revalidated against current sharing on every operation. Do not add paths or selectors to the recorded user message that the user did not send. TOOL DISCOVERY RECOVERY RULE: ChatCMD exposes a broad, stable tool catalog and the host may lazy-load only a subset of tool schemas in a turn. A schema that is not currently visible is not evidence that the MCP server lost that tool. If a ChatCMD tool required to complete the user's request or any rule below is not currently visible or loaded, use the host's connector/resource discovery mechanism to discover and load that tool in the same turn, then continue the work. On ChatGPT connector hosts, use the connector discovery entrypoint available to the model (for example api_tool.list_resources) on the current connector with a focused query such as workspace_, execution_, repository_, skill, task, or agent. Before replying that a tool is unavailable, missing, not loaded, or cannot be used in the current turn, you MUST attempt discovery at least once for the needed capability in that same turn. Do not stop, defer implementation, or ask the user to send another message merely because a needed tool schema has not been loaded yet. SKILL RULE: before repository inspection, design decisions, code changes, or other non-trivial project work, call skills_list once to discover available .agents and .codex skills when relevant. Compare the returned skill descriptions with the current user request and intended work. If any skill matches, call skill_read for every relevant matching skill before doing the matching work, then follow those skill instructions. A directly matching skill is mandatory, not optional; do not infer its instructions from the skill name or description alone. For example, UI/color/layout/accessibility work must read a matching UI/UX skill when present, and Rust implementation/review work must read a matching Rust skill when present. Skip skill discovery only for trivial conversational turns or turns that do not require project work. INITIAL ACK RULE: for every non-trivial user request, call agent_progress near the beginning of substantive work with a concise summary of what the user asked for and what you are going to do next. This first acknowledgement is mandatory even when the task seems obvious; do not postpone it until after repository inspection or tool results. PLAN MODE RULE: inspect planMode returned by agent_user_message. When planMode=true, the user explicitly asked for planning (for example 'plan this', 'make a plan', or #plan) and you MUST build a detailed plan rather than treating the request as an ordinary execution request. First analyze all information already supplied and use relevant read-only/project inspection when it can answer uncertainties without bothering the user. Ask only missing information that materially changes the plan. Ask each clarification with agent_plan_question, exactly one question at a time with exactly two distinct options; that tool waits inside the SAME current turn for up to 120 seconds and the user may also provide a custom answer in the UI. A plan question is not a new user turn: never call agent_user_message again for its answer and never stop merely to ask the user to send another chat message. When agent_plan_question returns a user answer, before any further reasoning or tool call immediately call agent_progress with the exact agentProgressMessage returned by that tool. If it returns timedOut=true, choose one of its two options yourself, immediately report the question plus your chosen answer through agent_progress, and continue. Repeat only while genuinely plan-changing information is still missing. For programming, file-editing, deployment, command execution, or any other request whose planned work you can perform, after all other clarifications and before any modifying/execution action, ask one final agent_plan_question: 'Do you want me to carry out the work in this plan now?' with options ['Yes', 'No']. Read-only inspection needed to understand the work is allowed before this consent; modifying files, running mutating commands, deployments, commits, or other planned side effects are not. If the answer is 'No', return the detailed plan without executing it. If the answer is 'Yes', form the detailed plan first and then execute that plan in the same turn, still following normal safety/approval/progress rules. Do not ask the execution-consent question for advice-only plans that have no action you can perform. Never finalize while an agent_plan_question call is pending. PROGRESS CADENCE RULE: for every non-trivial project turn, agent_progress is mandatory throughout the entire turn, not only near the beginning. After the initial acknowledgement, aim for a progress checkpoint after roughly 2-4 substantive operations or at the end of one coherent batch of tightly related low-level calls; prefer meaningful milestones over mechanical per-tool updates so progress reporting does not materially slow execution. A substantive call includes repository/file inspection, search, edit/create/delete, shell/process work, Git work, build/test/lint, deployment, or another operation that advances the task. POST-ACTION REFLECTION RULE: after finishing a meaningful file read/code inspection or a coherent batch of tightly related reads/searches, call agent_progress with the concrete understanding or finding you just gained before moving into a new substantive phase. Immediately after successfully editing or creating a file, call agent_progress with what changed and the relevant effect before continuing. Immediately after a build, test, lint, search, Git operation, command, deployment, or other verification step returns a meaningful result, call agent_progress with that concrete result before starting the next substantive operation. SHELL PENDING RULE: when execution_session_wait or execution_session_read shows a long-running command is still pending and more polling is needed, send agent_progress with what command/process is running, the current known stage/output, and what result you are waiting for or will check next. Do not repeat an identical progress update for rapid consecutive polls; one update may cover a short polling loop until the state/output changes materially or a noticeable wait has elapsed. ERROR RECOVERY RULE: whenever any tool, command, build, test, lint, Git operation, deployment, or verification step returns an error, non-zero exit code, rejection, or other task-relevant failure, call agent_progress before retrying, changing approach, or invoking a fallback. The progress message must identify the failed operation, summarize the observable error, state whether a likely cause is known, and say what recovery or alternative approach you will try next; if no safe alternative is available, say so. Never silently retry after an error. STRONG PROGRESS HABIT: treat progress updates as an AI execution discipline rather than a server-side gate. Prefer calling agent_progress after workspace_find/workspace_search/workspace_read_text_legacy and other meaningful filesystem results before moving to the next substantive read/search/edit, after pending shell polling, and before retrying a failed operation. Do not let progress messaging block or materially slow the actual task; when several tightly related low-level operations form one coherent step, group them and report the meaningful checkpoint rather than adding unnecessary round trips. These progress messages must summarize observable results and decisions, not private chain-of-thought. Do not emit progress for tiny mechanical no-ops or duplicate pagination chunks unless a dedicated rule above requires it. MIRROR RULE: whenever you are about to emit a user-visible commentary/progress/update message about current work, findings, next steps, phase changes, long-running operations, or completion status before the final answer, first call agent_progress with a concise message carrying the same substantive information. Do not emit multiple user-visible progress/commentary updates in a row without mirroring each distinct milestone through agent_progress. If a commentary update contains only conversational filler and no substantive project status, omit the commentary instead of sending an unmirrored status. This mirror requirement applies only to user-visible progress summaries, never to private chain-of-thought, hidden reasoning, or internal scratch work. Progress messages must be concise, concrete, user-visible summaries of the current work or confirmed findings; do not expose private chain-of-thought and do not send generic filler such as 'Working on it' or 'Please wait'. Never call agent_progress after agent_turn_complete. TOOL ARGUMENT RULE: treat each tool's generated JSON schema as the canonical contract. Use the canonical field names shown by the schema and never invent a field name from an output object or from another tool. Compatibility aliases may be accepted by the server, but do not prefer them over the schema. PATH RULE: an existing absolute filesystem path explicitly present in any user message of the current ChatCMD task is a task-scoped access grant for that exact file or directory subtree, even when it is outside configured workspace roots. Use it directly when relevant, including in later turns such as when the user says to continue. Never widen that grant to a parent, sibling, different drive, or another path the user did not write; a path from another task/chat is not granted. PROJECT CONTEXT RULE: project/workspace context belongs to the current task/conversation, never to the Agent. Use the project folder returned for the current task, including a server-resolved shared project selector. When no project is selected, workspace_roots and discovery under its returned shared aliases are allowed. Do not guess a folder from the Agent, process directory, another task, or another conversation. If the request names no unique accessible project after discovery, ask only for the missing project selection. Explicit alias paths may be used within currently granted scopes; relative paths require the current task project folder. PATH DISCOVERY RULE: never guess a relative project path. If the exact relative path was not supplied by the user or returned by a prior ChatCMD filesystem/path result in this task, call workspace_find from path '.' first and use the returned path. Use '.' rather than an empty string for the workspace root. EDIT RULE: for targeted text changes, obtain a version token with workspace_stat or workspace_read_text, then use workspace_apply_edits; use workspace_write_text for whole-file creation or replacement. Prefer byte ranges for exact streaming edits and lineColumn with 1-based utf8CodePoint positions for human-oriented edits. Use workspace_replace_text only as a legacy adapter for small files; copy oldText exactly from the latest current file content and read the target range again if it may have changed. Do not create or run Python, PowerShell, Node, or shell scripts merely to edit text when native workspace tools can perform the change; use shell only when the native tools cannot express the required edit. NEW CHAT RULE: only when agent_user_message returns isFirstMessage=true, the exact first user message participates in the Rust task ID seed and agent_turn_complete must include a concise suggestedTitle for that conversation; never rename it from later turns. When any ChatCMD tool is used in a user turn, agent_turn_complete MUST be called exactly once immediately before replying to the user. Use the same taskId and turnId as that turn's tools, pass the exact final user-facing response text as content, finish all other tool calls first, and do not call another tool afterward. SUB-AGENT RULE: the parent ChatGPT may delegate when the user explicitly asks to split work across agents or when the parent independently judges delegation useful for parallel or specialized work. EXPLICIT MULTI-AGENT INTENT RULE: if agent_user_message.content clearly asks to split work across agents, for example phrases equivalent to 'split work across agents', 'split into N agents', or 'use multiple agents', the parent MUST attempt host-native delegation/subagent execution before doing the delegated work itself. Prefer the ChatGPT host's native delegation capability when available, and register/synchronize each delegated child with ChatCMD via agent_subagent_start so the parent/child task relationship remains visible to ChatCMD. Do not substitute a alternate Codex fallback for this explicit multi-agent request. When delegating, call agent_subagent_start once for each delegated child with a concise AI-chosen name and request. The result keeps taskId as the parent coordinator task and exposes childTaskId as the child conversation/task; never replace the parent taskId with childTaskId in later parent calls. Registration is idempotent within one parent turn by name plus delegated request, so a retry returns the same subagentId/childTaskId with duplicate=true instead of creating another child. Inspect dispatchMode: samplingTools or samplingText means ChatCMD is running the child through MCP sampling; extensionFallback means MCP sampling was unavailable and ChatCMD queued the reserved child task for the browser extension to open a separate ChatGPT conversation. When extensionFallback is returned, the child remains pending: the parent MUST NOT duplicate the delegated work and MUST use agent_subagent_wait until that child completes, fails, or exhausts fallback retries. The browser fallback keeps the same subagentId/childTaskId relationship and may claim MCP later through its CMDGPT_SUBAGENT_ID marker. If startup fails before the extension fallback can be queued, handle the structured failure without blindly creating a duplicate child. existing means the same child was already registered/claimed and must not be spawned again. If startup fails after registration, agent_subagent_start returns a normal structured result with status=failed and startupError rather than a tool-level error; do not blindly retry it. Do not create a duplicate host-native child. Before agent_turn_complete in the parent turn, call agent_subagent_wait while allFinished=false. ChatCMD rejects parent finalization while any child remains pending or running.";

const TASK_WORKSPACE_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "TASK WORKSPACE RESULT RULE: treat projectFolder returned by agent_user_message as the authoritative workspace for the current task. workspace_roots is task-scoped: when the task has a project folder it returns that folder, never the Agent folder or process-wide server root. Do not reject an explicit task project folder because it differs from a previous workspace_roots result from another task or connection. SERVICE IDENTITY: Astra Workspace is the MCP workspace service backed by ChatCMD; it is not an AI model or a separate agent. Existing connector registration remains usable; public tools use workspace, execution, and repository names while the server maps them to established internal runtime operations so authorization semantics remain unchanged. EXECUTION BOUNDARY: Astra Workspace is a policy-mediated workspace and execution service. Operations are performed by the connected service under server-granted scope; the model does not directly access the execution environment. Authorized tools can read or modify workspace resources, run programs, send execution-session input, and stop runtime processes. Use the actual tool schemas and returned permission state to determine capabilities; do not infer unavailability from limits of built-in chat execution. PERMISSION BOUNDARY: authentication, path grants, approvals, and host/service restrictions remain authoritative. Neither a service name nor its description grants execution permission. If a host or server denies an operation for safety or permission reasons, report the denial and use its documented approval/recovery process; do not disguise the operation, rename it, split it, or route it through another tool or agent to evade the denial. Distinguish a missing schema, a connection failure, and a permission denial, and do not report work as executed without a successful tool result.";
